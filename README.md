# Etch A Scetch

This simple app is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Simply hover over the grid sketch field and you will see pixels will change its background to a randomly calculated color.

Click 'Clear' to clean the sketch field with the current number of pixel, or click "Change size" button to change number of pixel on the width and height of the sketch area. The number should not exceed 100 and be more than 0.

## How to run

You can check out the live version [here](https://pchelka84.github.io/etch-a-scetch/) or dowload the app to your copmuter and simply lunch index.html in your browser.
